# Swinburne Library Management System
This is a library management system, the main purpose of this system is to help the client to search for their preferred books, add new books to the library system and record book lending history.
We developed an API back-end endpoint by using PHP programming language, to connect to MySQL server and interact with the database. This API will return the value in JSON format and the library management system will interact with these records through API endpoint.
The front-end of this system used Vue 2 through Vue CLI with Vuetify, and the design of this library management system focus on usability with bright color and easy navigation throughout the pages.
