# Swinburne Library Management System
This is a library management system. The main purpose of this system is to help the users search for their preferred books, add new books to the library system, and record book lending history. We developed an API back-end endpoint by using the PHP programming language to connect to a MySQL server and interact with the database. This API back-end endpoint will return the value in JSON format, and the library management system will interact with these records through this API endpoint. The front-end technologies behind this project includes VueJS framework, Vue 2 through Vue CLI with Vuetify. The design of this library management system focused on usability with bright color and easy navigation throughout the pages.
